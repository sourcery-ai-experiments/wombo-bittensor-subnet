#### In the depths of a digital necropolis, an ancient AI Pharaoh slumbers, its consciousness encoded in cryptic algorithms. Only the worthy may awaken this power, but beware the spectral sentinels that guard its secrets, for they hold the key to humanity's fate.

## About WOMBO
[WOMBO](http://w.ai/) is one of the world’s leading consumer AI companies, and early believers in generative AI.

We've launched [two](http://wombo.ai/) #1 [apps](http://dream.ai/) - together, they’ve been **downloaded over 200M times** and have **each** **hit #1 on the app stores in 100+ countries**

These results were **only possible due to the immense capabilities of bleeding edge generative AI techniques and the power of open source AI**. Our unique understanding of this research space through a consumer entertainment lens allows us to craft products people love to use and share.

We are at the very beginning of the Synthetic Media Revolution, which will completely transform how people create, consume, and distribute content. We're building the apps and infrastructure to power this and bring AI entertainment potential to the masses.

## Subnet 30
Our mission is to spread fun and creative uses of Al to enhance the human experience. This subnet is the foundation of a decentralized content creation and distribution engine that will transform digital media. With an initial focus on generating captivating images featuring TAO symbolology, the subnet is evolving to support a wide array of media formats and modalities.

Subnet 30 generates compelling content, powers real-world applications, and incentivizes digital posting and social sharing. As the subnet expands, it will unlock new opportunities for people to earn subnet emissions directly through their social media performance.

## Miners and Validators Functionallity

### Incentive Mechanism and Reward Structure

Subnet 30 incentivizes miners and validators to contribute to the generation and validation of high-quality, engaging content through a unique reward mechanism.

The reward mechanism for Subnet 30 scores the initial response based on the average similarity of randomly selected diffusion steps, rather than the final image. This approach reduces the computation required by validators, preventing them from doubling their workload. The score is then multiplied by the requests per second (RPS) the miner can handle and the success rate to adjust the weight based on the miner's error rate.

Miners are incentivized based on their concurrency, which measures their ability to handle production load. This encourages miners to run behind load balancers to increase the number of requests they can process simultaneously, ultimately improving the subnet's overall performance and reliability.

Currently, Subnet 30 primarily uses randomized strings for validation, with a 25% chance of validating real user data submitted through front-end applications. Failing validation on real user data incurs a higher penalty, as it may indicate an attempt to cheat the system. In the future, the subnet plans to replace randomized validation strings with actual prompts sourced from a prompt bank containing over 2 billion entries.

Successful generation for real user requests grants a bonus to miners, while failing to respond to a user request entirely results in a harsh penalty, as it reduces the overall reliability of the subnet.

### Miners
- Receieve prompts or validation strings from the subnet.
- Generating images or other content using the custom models and content generation tools.
- Return the generated content to the subnet for validation and distribution.

### Validators
- Generate queries for miners using randomly generated prompts or actual user requests submitted through applications on the subnet.
- Validate the content generated by miners using the provided diffusion similarity scoring API or by running their own instance of the API for increased decentralization.
- Score the validated content based on relevance, novelty, and detail richness.
- Submit batches of validated content to the subnet for distribution and storage.

## Running Miners and Validators

### Running a miner

#### Requirements
- Recommended: GPU with at least 24GB of VRAM

#### Setup

To start, clone the repository and `cd` to it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/womboai/wombo-bittensor-subnet
cd wombo-bittensor-subnet
```

### The image generator API
Miners by default use an API for image generation, this can be set up as follows, with either PM2 or docker:

#### PM2
Set the python packages up

```bash
cd image-generator
./setup.sh
```

Then run with PM2
```bash
pm2 start run.sh --name wombo-image-generator --interpreter bash
```

#### Docker
Create a .env file from example.env

```bash
cd image-generator
# Copy the example environment file
cp example.env .env
```

Then simply run the image generator.
```bash
./run_docker.sh
```

### Running the miner neuron

To set the miner neuron up,

#### PM2
Set the python packages up

```bash
cd miner
./setup.sh
```

Then run with PM2, replacing the arguments 
```bash
pm2 start run.sh --name wombo-miner --interpreter bash -- \
    --netuid {netuid} \
    --wallet.name {wallet} \
    --wallet.hotkey {hotkey} \
    --generation_endpoint http://localhost:8001/api/generate \
    --blacklist.force_validator_permit
```

#### Docker
Create a .env file from example.env
```bash
cd miner
# Copy the example environment file and edit it
cp example.env .env
$EDITOR .env
```

Then simply run the registered miner
```bash
./run_docker.sh
```

The miner will then run on your network provided the port `8091` is open.
The responsibility of keeping the miner/repo up-to-date falls on you, hence you should `git pull` every once in a while.

### Running a validator
Running a validator is similar to running a miner, with either PM2 or Docker:

#### Requirements
- **Minimum:** CPU only, Subnet 30 provides a diffusion similarity scoring API that handles the GPU-intensive portion of validation
- **Recommended:** Running an instance of the similarity scoring API as it increases decentralization of the validation process


#### PM2
Set the python packages up

```bash
cd validator
./setup.sh
```

Then run with PM2, replacing the arguments 
```bash
run_pm2.sh wombo-validator \
    --netuid {netuid} \
    --wallet.name {wallet} \
    --wallet.hotkey {hotkey}
```

(wombo-validator is the PM2 process name)

#### Docker
Create a .env file from example.env

```bash
cd validator
# Copy the example environment file and edit it
cp example.env .env
$EDITOR .env
```

Then simply run the registered validator with
```bash
./run_docker.sh
```

The run script will keep your validator up to date, so as long as the .env file is correct, everything should run properly.

### Validator Decentralization
To increase decentralization, running validator-api locally is recommended.
This requires a GPU.

#### PM2
Set the python packages up

```bash
cd validator-api
./setup.sh
```

Run the validator API
```bash
NETWORK={network} NETUID={netuid} pm2 start run.sh --name wombo-validator-api --interpreter bash
```

#### Docker
Create a .env file from example.env
```bash
cd validator-api
# Copy the example environment file and edit it
cp example.env .env
$EDITOR .env
```

Run the validator API
```bash
./run_docker.sh
```

Then finally add `--validation_endpoint http://localhost:8001/api/validate` to the validator arguments, changing the port and host as necessary.
